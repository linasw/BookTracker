# Book Tracker

!!! STILL IN PROGRESS !!!
Book Tracker is a simple app coded in C# made to track your read/to be read books  
It uses [Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) framework to make work with WPF easier and [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) to help out with database entities

## Usage

No idea how to make it work on another device (probably a database is going to be missing. I will try to figure it out later)
